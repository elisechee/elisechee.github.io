                    Medium: Website / Interactive Media  &emsp; Tools: Adobe Photoshop, Blender, Figma, Vscode (HTML, CSS, JS)
                    <br><br>
                    Present is Purgatory, is an interactive 3D digital space that visualizes the present as a liminal dimension between the past and the future.  This piece explores the emotional and philosophical tension of being “stuck in time,” grappling with the unalterable nature of the past and the uncertainty of the future. 
                    <br><br>
                    To further explore the relationship between past, present, and future: I combined analog methods with digital ones. The elements were cut out from old magazines or sourced from the public source images and collaged on a piece of paper which was then modified digitally in Adobe Photoshop. Afterwards, the collage elements were extracted into separate 2D layers which were formatted in Blender and modified in the Three.js editor and finally put into web format through HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
                    <br><br>
                    If the past is a ghost that we can’t reach or alter, the future a vision that oscillates between dream & nightmare, the present could be thought of as an intermediary state (a temporal purgatory). Though the name might pass off as negative, enough time in this 3d space and we may realize that the present is where we are meant to be.
